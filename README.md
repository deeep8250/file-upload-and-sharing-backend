<h1>🧭 Project Title: File Upload & Sharing System </h1>




📌 1. What this project actually does

This project is a mini Google Drive / Dropbox backend system.
It allows users to:

-Upload large files (like videos, PDFs, images)
-Download or view them later
-Share files with others through secure time-bound links
-You will build this system using:
-Golang (Gin) → for API backend
-PostgreSQL → to store metadata (file information)
-MinIO → to store actual file data
-Docker Compose → to run everything locally (Go + Postgres + MinIO)




🎯 2. Main Goal

To learn how real-world systems handle large file uploads safely, efficiently, and securely —
without crashing the backend or exposing private data.

-You will learn how to:
-Use object storage (MinIO) for saving files
-Generate presigned URLs so users can upload/download files directly
-Store metadata in PostgreSQL
-Design clean API endpoints (handlers) for upload, confirm, list, download, and share




🧩 3. Core Concept (in simple words)

Normally, when a user uploads a file → the file passes through your backend → then gets saved.
That works for small files, but not for large ones (like 500 MB videos).

So, in this project:

-Your backend doesn’t touch the big file.
-Instead, it gives the user a special temporary upload link (presigned URL).
-The user uploads directly to MinIO using that link.
-Your backend just stores information (metadata) about that file in PostgreSQL.
-That’s how cloud systems like Google Drive, Dropbox, and YouTube handle large uploads.

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | Auto-generated file ID                                  |
| `owner_id`     | ID of the user who uploaded                             |
| `filename`     | Original file name                                      |
| `bucket_name`  | Name of the MinIO bucket (e.g. `user-files`)            |
| `object_key`   | Unique key/path of file inside the bucket               |
| `size_bytes`   | File size (auto-fetched from MinIO after upload)        |
| `content_type` | Type of file (auto-fetched from MinIO)                  |
| `status`       | Upload status (`pending_upload`, `uploaded`, `deleted`) |
| `created_at`   | When record was created                                 |
| `uploaded_at`  | When upload finished                                    |

7. Project Flow (Step by Step)


Step 1️⃣ — User requests upload

-User sends file name + metadata to backend.
-Backend creates a record in Postgres (status = pending_upload).
-Backend asks MinIO for a presigned PUT URL.
-Backend sends that URL back to the user.


Step 2️⃣ — User uploads file

-User (via Postman or frontend) uses that URL to upload the file directly to MinIO.
-File gets stored on your local disk (inside MinIO’s data folder).


Step 3️⃣ — Confirm upload

-Backend checks file in MinIO (using StatObject) to get size and content-type.
-Updates Postgres record → status = uploaded.


Step 4️⃣ — Download or share

-Backend can generate presigned GET URL for secure downloads.
-Or generate share links that expire after a set time.

| `PostPresignUpload`          | Create DB record + generate presigned upload URL    |
| `PostConfirmUpload`          | Confirm upload, get size/type from MinIO, update DB |
| `GetFileList`                | Show all files uploaded by a user                   |
